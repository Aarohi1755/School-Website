The profound impact he created in that moment remains unforgettable in the history of World Peace and Unity. The Birth Anniversary of Swami Vivekananda is commemorated across the country as the National Youth Day, celebrating the spirit of youthfulness and the inspiring way of life led by this great intellectual, social and spiritual icon.

                        TAFS,Junior Wing too observed the National Youth Day on 12 Jan 22, with the purpose of making children aware of the principles and ideals of Swami Vivekananda and their relevance in present times.The students were introduced to the life lessons of the patriot saint through a presentation. A special assembly was conducted and the motivating stories of Swami Vivekananda’s life were shared. 
                        
                        Class 2 was shown a video on the life of Swami Vivekananda which was followed by a fun quiz based on it. Class 3 too learnt about Swami Vivekananda through a video and specific incidents of his life were shared in the class.
                        
                        A short quiz was conducted for Classes 4 and 5 after a presentation on the life of Swami Vivekananda and the students also submitted drawings,paintings and posters based on his life.
                        
                        The children also dressed in hues of saffron as Swami Vivekananda were a sight to behold. Swami Vivekananda’s teachings continue to reverberate in our Indian ethos and the onus is upon us to draw valuable learnings from them.
